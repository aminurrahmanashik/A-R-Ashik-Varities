Increasingly, quantitative hedge funds and asset managers will trade algorithmically, 
with computers designed to scan the internet for news stories and interpret whether 
news reports contain any useful information which would allow a revision of probabilistic
 beliefs (we have already seen an example of this with the Monty Hall problem, 
and will formally consider ‘Bayesian updating’ in week 2). Here, the demand for 
‘tough Brexit negotiations’ by the then French President would be interpreted as 
being bad for the UK, which would lead to a further depreciation in the pound sterling.
